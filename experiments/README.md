# Experiments
This project is currently broke into three sections.

- Arduino
- Hardware
- UserInterface

# Arduino
In this folder contains Ventilator code experiments designed to work on an ESP32 microcontroller. It is not the working ventilator code, instead it contains experimental code used as proof of concepts for parts of the project.

# Hardware
This is too be determined soon

# UserInterface
This folder contains code that will be used as a user interface to change settings in the Ventilator and see patient diagnostic information
